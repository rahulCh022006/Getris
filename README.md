# Getris

## This project involves creating a fully functional Tetris clone using the Godot Engine. The game features classic Tetris mechanics, including a 10x20 grid, seven Tetrimino shapes, gravity, line clearing, and level progression. Players can control the Tetriminos through intuitive keyboard inputs. With a scoring system, next piece preview, and increasing difficulty, this project provides a comprehensive introduction to game development in Godot, focusing on core mechanics, UI design, and game state management.
